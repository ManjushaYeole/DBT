1.Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as combinations ofcnum and snum are different from one another,and so that NULL values are excluded 
 from the date field.
->create table Orders1(
  Onum int(12),
  Cnum int(12),
  Snum int(12),
  Check (Onum!=Cnum and Onum!=Snum and Cnum!=Snum));

2.Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no NULLS permitted,snum is the primary key,and all names fall alphabetically between
 A and M,inclusive(assume all names will be uppercase).
->create table Salespeople1(
  Snum int(12) primary key
  check (status between 'A' and 'M'),
  Comm float(3,2)default 0.10));

3.Create the Orders table,making sure that the onum is greater the cnum,and the cnum is greater than the snum.Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
->create table  Orders2(
  Snum int(12) NOT NULL,
  Cnum int(12) NOT NULL,
  Onum int(12) NOT NULL,
  check(Cnum>Snum),
  check(Onum>Cnum));
